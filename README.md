# hello-world

Hi, I'm KayJay.

I'm currently a student a NuCamp. I'm looking to switch into a software development career. I've worked to the City of Arlington for 8 1/2 years. I minored in Computer Applications and Computer Forensics. During my time in college I learned C++, HTML, and CSS.
I love music, books, and diy projects!
The most recent project I'm currently on a 8ft custom desk with wireless charging.
